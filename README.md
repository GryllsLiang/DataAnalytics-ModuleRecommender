This project is a course recommender, which uses course specilization, course workload and course introduction as the main feature. As for course introduction, I used countervector to convert it into numerical input. To make improvements, I used feature dimension reduction method Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and it improves the f1-score by around 50%.

This project contains 2 dataset, courses.tsv and students.tsv. Courses.tsv contains course Code(Primary Key) Credits, Information, Specialisation. Students.tsv contains Students contains GPA Range, Degree, Specialization, GPA and courses the chose, where we only focus on the courses, treating the first 5 as our input, and other courses as the ground truth for the recommender.

I found that if workload is in the same dimension with the converted text feature, that may be considered as a high-weight feature, to avoid this, I tried to dipose it as categorical feature, and find in some cases it helps. I reviewed this proceduer, and find that this processing method is a little unreasonable, it could lose the value information, which means it cannot make comparision after it is regarded as categorical. And in the end, I used the normal method, only plus PCA as my final submission.
